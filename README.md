# project1_class

This is a simple example on C++ to show how to define a class, set its variables and handling the I/O traffic from class's private variables.

You can run the program using 
```
make all // or simply 'make'
make run
```

And boom! Program's running!

If you would like to contribute, I would appreciate it.
